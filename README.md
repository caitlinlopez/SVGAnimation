# SVGAnimation
An animation project using SVG that shows a monochromatic room with malfunctioning machines (like in horror movies). Functionality includes clicking on the tv buttons to turn the
tv on and off, hovering over the door to slowly open it, clicking on the door to go outside, and a lamp that slowly turns on and off by itself.
